## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="117102154.jpg">

Hi! I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading. My project looks into the potential applications of decadal predictions for the energy sector. I also work part-time as a Science Engagement Fellow for the Royal Meteorological Society, where we bring together professionals, policymakers, and academics to discuss the challenges facing the energy sector.
