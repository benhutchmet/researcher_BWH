My PhD looks into the potential applications of decadal predictions for the energy-sector. As power systems more heavily rely on variable renewable energy technologies (such as wind turbines and solar PV), ensuring supply security becomes more challenging due to the impacts of climate variability and climate change. [Decadal predictions](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/seasonal-to-decadal/decadal-prediction#:~:text=The%20decadal%20predictions%20system%2C%20Met,(volcanic%20and%20solar%20activity).), which are climate forecasts run over the next decade, try to quantify the impacts of climate variability and climate change, so can be useful for quantifying this uncertainty. Broadly, there are two ways in which decadal predictions can be used to quantify uncertainty for the energy-sector:

1. As decadal predictions - where the evolution of a variable of interest for the next 5-10 years is predicted.
2. As a large ensemble of physically plausible events - where the potential for more extreme events than those existing in the observational record can be quantified.
