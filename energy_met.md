# Energy-Meteorology Research Group

At the University of Reading, I lead the [energy-meteorology](https://research.reading.ac.uk/met-energy/) research group (colloquially known as 'energy-met').

The aim of energy-met is to better understand the impact of weather and climate on the energy sector, and to develop new ways to exploit weather and climate information for energy risk management.

We host internal and external speakers, discuss the latest research advancements, and use the group as a platform for further collaboration.

<!-- Section on current group members
e.g. David, Ben, Izzi, Salim etc.
Section on Energy-Met alumni
e.g. Dan Drew, Hannah, James etc. -->

Group meetings occur every other Tuesday during semester time, 10-11AM, in 1L35, in-person and on Teams.
